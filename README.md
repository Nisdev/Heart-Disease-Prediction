For a chosen dataset, a complete study using the interface that we've implemented was made.
The dataset we've studied is "Heart Disease Dataset", it is made available to us via the UCI website : Staglog Heart .

**Output**

- Application web R Shiny : https://1project.shinyapps.io/Heart_Disease/. 

You just have to load the file "heart (1).csv" in the interface in order to visualize all the analyses made and to make predictions so that you know whether a patient suffers from a heart disease or not.
